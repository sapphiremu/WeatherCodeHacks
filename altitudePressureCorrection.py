# altitude correction
# Â©Saffron Murcia 2023
# v 0.1
# v 0.2 - Added funcionality for different plantary bodies.
#         Thanks @DeltaDroid for suggestion.
# Code to provide the pressure variance in hPa at altitude in 
# metres that will need to be added to raw pressure readings 
# for standard readouts.
